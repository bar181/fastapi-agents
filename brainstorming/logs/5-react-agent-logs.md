# RUV ReAct Decision Engine Agent Implementation Log

This document tracks the progress of implementing the RUV ReAct Decision Engine agent as outlined in the plan.

## Step 1: Set Up the Agent Structure - Completed

The agent structure has been set up in `brainstorming/agents/ruv_react_decision_engine.py`. The file includes the necessary imports and basic structure for the agent.

- **Dependencies**:
  - FastAPI
  - Requests
  - OpenRouter API

- **Key Components**:
  - `ChatMessage` class for representing messages in the conversation
  - `Tool` class for representing tools that the agent can use
  - `Agent` class for implementing the reasoning capabilities
  - `call_openrouter` function for interacting with the OpenRouter API
  - `run_agent` function for executing the ReAct loop
  - FastAPI endpoints for handling requests

## Step 2: Create OpenRouter Agent - Completed

Created a new OpenRouter agent in `brainstorming/agents/openrouter_agent.py` based on the structure of the OpenAI agent. This agent provides a clean interface for interacting with the OpenRouter API.

- **Key Components**:
  - `OpenRouterAgent` class for interacting with the OpenRouter API
  - `test_connection` method for testing the connection to the API
  - `process_prompt` method for processing prompts with more options

## Step 3: Create OpenRouter Routes - Completed

Created routes for the OpenRouter agent in `brainstorming/agents/openrouter_routes.py` based on the structure of the OpenAI routes. These routes provide endpoints for interacting with the OpenRouter API.

- **Key Components**:
  - `register_routes` function for registering the routes with the provided APIRouter
  - `/openrouter-hello` endpoint for testing the connection to the API
  - `/openrouter-prompt` endpoint for processing prompts with more options

## Step 4: Update Routes LLM - Completed

Updated the `brainstorming/app/routes_llm.py` file to include the OpenRouter routes. This makes the OpenRouter endpoints accessible through the FastAPI application.

- **Changes**:
  - Added import for the OpenRouter routes
  - Added registration of the OpenRouter routes with the router

## Step 5: Create Tests - Completed

Created tests for the OpenRouter agent and the RUV ReAct Decision Engine agent:

- **OpenRouter Agent Tests** (`brainstorming/tests/test_openrouter_agent.py`):
  - Test the OpenRouter hello endpoint
  - Test the OpenRouter prompt endpoint
  - Test handling of custom models
  - Test handling of invalid models

- **RUV ReAct Decision Engine Agent Tests** (`brainstorming/tests/test_ruv_react_agent.py`):
  - Test the RUV ReAct Decision Engine endpoint
  - Test the RUV ReAct Decision Engine query endpoint
  - Test deductive reasoning for financial, medical, and legal domains
  - Test inductive reasoning for financial, medical, and legal domains
  - Test the calculator tool
  - Test handling of invalid queries and domains

## Next Steps

The next steps will involve:

1. Running the tests to verify the functionality of the agents
2. Making any necessary adjustments based on the test results
3. Documenting the final implementation in the logs

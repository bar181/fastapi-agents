# Phase 3: Gemini Integration - COMPLETED

## Initial Setup
- Reviewed existing code and documentation
- Updated implementation plan with detailed steps
- Identified reference patterns from OpenAI implementation
- Added google-generativeai to requirements.txt

## Implementation Details
- Implemented GeminiAgent class with actual API integration
- Created separate agent files for each endpoint:
  - gemini_hello.py for the /gemini-hello endpoint
  - gemini_prompt.py for the /gemini-prompt endpoint
  - openai_hello.py for the /openai-hello endpoint
  - openai_prompt.py for the /openai-prompt endpoint
- Added proper error handling and response formatting
- Implemented support for different models and parameters
- Added estimated usage tracking for API calls
- Followed the single-responsibility principle by separating agent and routes
- Added model validation against a list of supported models
- Implemented system message handling for chat context

## Provider Selection Implementation
- Created provider_hello.py for the /provider-hello endpoint
  - Allows selecting between Gemini and OpenAI providers
  - Defaults to Gemini if no provider is specified
  - Validates provider against available providers list
- Created provider_prompt.py for the /provider-prompt endpoint
  - Accepts POST requests with JSON body
  - Includes provider selection in the request body
  - Supports all parameters from both Gemini and OpenAI
  - Validates provider using Pydantic enum
- Updated routes_llm.py to register all endpoints
- Added comprehensive tests for all endpoints

## Issues and Solutions
- Gemini API doesn't provide exact token usage statistics like OpenAI
  - Solution: Implemented estimated token usage based on character count
- Gemini API has different parameter names compared to OpenAI
  - Solution: Mapped common parameters to their Gemini equivalents
- Provider validation needed to be consistent across endpoints
  - Solution: Added AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS list to each provider class

## Test Results
- All tests are now passing successfully:
  - test_dspy_agents.py: 4 tests passed
  - test_llm_agents.py: 10 tests passed (including new provider tests)
  - test_main.py: 3 tests passed
  - test_starter_agents.py: 1 test passed
  - Total: 18 tests passed
- There was a warning about grpc_wait_for_shutdown_with_timeout() timing out, but it didn't affect the test results

## Documentation Updates
- Updated llm-guide.md with Gemini implementation details
- Added example usage for Gemini agent
- Documented supported models and parameters
- Added error handling considerations
- Updated README.md with complete list of available LLM agents

## Environment Configuration Updates
- Updated .env.sample to include GEMINI_MODEL with default value of gemini-2.0
- Updated GeminiAgent class to use gemini-2.0 as the default model if not specified in .env
- Added gemini-2.0 to the list of supported models in the GeminiAgent class
- Updated llm-guide.md to reflect the correct default model

## Code Restructuring
- Reorganized the code to follow a more modular approach:
  - Split gemini_routes.py into separate files:
    - gemini_hello.py - Contains only the /gemini-hello endpoint
    - gemini_prompt.py - Contains only the /gemini-prompt endpoint
  - Split openai_routes.py into separate files:
    - openai_hello.py - Contains only the /openai-hello endpoint
    - openai_prompt.py - Contains only the /openai-prompt endpoint
  - Created provider_hello.py for the /provider-hello endpoint
  - Created provider_prompt.py for the /provider-prompt endpoint
  - Updated routes_llm.py to register all the individual routes
- Each agent file now follows a consistent pattern:
  - Class definition with clear documentation
  - Standalone usage examples
  - Error handling for API key configuration
  - Detailed API documentation with input/output examples
- Updated tests to work with the new structure

## Phase 3 Completion
- Successfully implemented Gemini integration
- Successfully implemented provider selection endpoints
- All tests are passing
- Documentation has been updated
- Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (LLM Agents Implementation)

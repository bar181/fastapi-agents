# Guide to the /logs Section

## Purpose of the /logs Section

The `/logs` directory serves as a central repository for tracking and documenting progress throughout the development lifecycle. Each log entry follows a structured naming convention:

### **Naming Conventions**
```
<step integer>-log.md             e.g. 1-logs.md
<step integer>-<step increment>-log.md    e.g. 1-1-logs.md
```

### **Log Types**
- **Primary Step Logs (e.g., `1-logs.md`)**: Summarize the key milestones and decisions for a development phase.
- **Advanced Incremental Logs (e.g., `1-1-logs.md`)**: Provide more granular tracking for major sub-steps within a phase.

## How /logs Fit into the Development Process

1. **Documentation of Actions:**  
   Every key development phase and step is recorded, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

2. **Tracking Progress:**  
   Logs serve as a historical record of decisions, completed tasks, and encountered issues.

3. **Issue Resolution & Debugging:**  
   Documenting encountered bugs, resolutions, and troubleshooting steps assists in future debugging efforts.

4. **Audit & Compliance:**  
   Logs provide traceability for reviewing development activities and validating completed work.

5. **Continuous Updates:**  
   Logs are maintained throughout the project to capture iterative updates, changes, and fixes.

## Structure of a Log Document

Each log document follows a standardized format to ensure clarity and consistency:

---

### **Example Log: `/logs/1-logs.md`**

#### **1. Summary**
- Overview of the phase covered by this log.
- Key goals and expectations.

#### **2. Completed Tasks**
- List of completed work items.
- References to relevant code changes or commits.

#### **3. Issues & Resolutions**
- Description of encountered issues.
- Steps taken to resolve them.
- Any remaining open issues for future resolution.

#### **4. Technical Debt & Future Considerations**
- Outstanding improvements or refinements.
- Notes on areas requiring further optimization.

#### **5. Next Steps**
- Outline of upcoming development tasks.
- Dependencies for future phases.

## Summary

The `/logs` directory ensures structured documentation of development efforts. By maintaining detailed logs, teams can track progress effectively, improve debugging efficiency, and provide traceability throughout the project lifecycle.

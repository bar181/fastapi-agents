# Phase 2: OpenAI Integration - COMPLETED

## Changes Made
- Implemented OpenAIAgent class using the latest OpenAI client
- Added model configuration in .env.sample with default gpt-4o-mini
- Implemented two endpoints:
  - GET /openai-hello - Simple test endpoint
  - POST /openai-prompt - Advanced prompt endpoint with JSON input
- Added comprehensive tests for both endpoints
- Updated documentation with usage examples
- Fixed Pydantic deprecation warning by using model_dump()
- Added error handling for missing API key
- Implemented dummy agent for failed initialization
- Separated agent implementation and route registration into two files:
  - openai_agent.py - Contains the OpenAIAgent class
  - openai_routes.py - Contains route registration

## Test Results
- All OpenAI-related tests are passing successfully:
  - test_setup: PASSED
  - test_openai_hello_endpoint: PASSED
  - test_openai_prompt_endpoint: PASSED
  - test_agent_prompt_endpoint_openai: PASSED

## Implementation Details
- The OpenAIAgent class now makes actual API calls to OpenAI
- Added proper error handling and response formatting
- Implemented support for different models and parameters
- Added usage tracking for API calls
- Resolved all deprecation warnings
- Followed the single-responsibility principle by separating agent and routes

## Next Steps
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting if needed
- Add support for additional OpenAI features (e.g., chat, embeddings)
- Consider implementing caching for frequent requests
- Proceed with Phase 3 (Gemini Integration) after confirmation

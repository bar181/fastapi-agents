# Plan for Confirming Environment Setup for LLM Agents Integration

#### **1. Objective**
- Establish a dedicated folder structure for LLM agents within the mono repo.
- Install required dependencies and configure environment variables.
- Set up and verify new tests for LLM agents (e.g., `test_llm_agents`).
- Confirm that the FastAPI app loads the LLM agent routes correctly.

---

#### **2. Overview**
- This phase focuses on the environment setup needed for integrating LLM agents.
- Key tasks include creating the necessary project directories, installing dependencies (FastAPI, openai, requests, pytest, etc.), and configuring environment variables.
- New tests (located in `tests/test_llm_agents.py`) will validate that the environment is correctly set up.
- Dependencies include the LLM providers' SDKs and testing frameworks.

---

#### **3. Implementation Steps**

##### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
- **Project Structure:**
  - Create a dedicated folder (e.g., `/llm_agents`) in the mono repo.
  - Within this folder, establish subdirectories: `/plans`, `/logs`, and `/tests`.
- **Dependency Installation:**
  - Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install openai requests pytest
    ```
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Configure your `.env` file with the required API keys and endpoints:
    ```python
    # .env file example
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_ENDPOINT="https://api.gemini.com/v1/endpoint"
    ```

##### **Step 2: Core Development**
- **Folder and File Setup:**
  - Confirm the creation of a new tests file: `tests/test_llm_agents.py`
- **Initial Test Implementation:**
  - Add a basic test to ensure the setup is correct:
    ```python
    # tests/test_llm_agents.py

    def test_setup():
        # This is a placeholder test to verify the test framework is operational.
        assert True  # Replace with actual environment setup tests as needed.
    ```
- **Expected JSON Response Format:**
  - For this phase, there is no endpoint response. The focus is on ensuring that tests run correctly.

##### **Step 3: API and Integrations**
- **FastAPI Integration:**
  - Update the main application to include the new LLM agent routes:
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from app.routes_llm import router as llm_router

    app = FastAPI(title="LLM Agents")
    app.include_router(llm_router)
    ```
- **Verification:**
  - Confirm that the FastAPI instance properly loads the LLM agent routes.

##### **Step 4: Testing & Validation**
- **Run Tests:**
  - Execute the test suite with:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```
  - Ensure that the new `test_llm_agents` test passes.
- **Logging:**
  - Document the test outcomes and any issues in `/logs/1-confirm-setup-logs.md`.

##### **Step 5: Documentation Updates**
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the `/docs/llm-guide.md` with details on environment setup.
  - Log progress and any encountered issues in `/logs/1-confirm-setup-logs.md`.

##### **Step 6: Next Steps**
- **Future Phases:**
  - Implement and test individual LLM endpoints.
  - Develop the five LLM agents (including multi-step and dspy-enabled agents).
  - Expand and refine tests for each agent as development progresses.
- **Dependencies for Future Work:**
  - Identify additional libraries or changes required for further LLM agent integration.

## Summary
This document confirms the initial environment setup for LLM agents integration. The setup includes creating the necessary folder structure, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and adding a basic test (`test_llm_agents`). With these steps completed, the system is ready for subsequent development phases, including the implementation of LLM endpoints and individual agent functionalities.
